# Reseller API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mollie/reseller-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mollie/reseller-api)

The [Reseller API](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/reseller-api/guides/overview) can be used to register new customers to Mollie, to link existing customers to your reseller account and to change the settings of the customers you have created.

The Reseller API uses [secure keys and signatures](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/reseller-api/guides/secret-keys) for authentication and security, unlike the [Mollie API](https://docs.mollie.com). With the Mollie API however, you can use [Mollie Connect](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/oauth2/authorize), with which you have the option to view invoices and create website profiles for existing customers.

If you are still missing reseller functions in our [Connect API](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/oauth2/authorize), let us know! But in the meantime, you are advised to use this Reseller API and we will of course provide full support.
